    • ✅ Comfort with API testing tools like Postman or Insomnia
    • ✅ Familiarity with Agile practices and code review workflows
    • ✅ Strong written and verbal communication skills (English required, French preferred)

    • French – Professional working proficiency (preferred)

Certifications (Nice to Have, Not Required)
    • AWS Certified Developer – Associate
    • Certified Scrum Developer (CSD) or equivalent

Company Culture
We care deeply about work-life balance, continuous learning, and diversity. Our team comes from all over the world, and we thrive on open communication, empathy, and trust. Expect weekly team lunches, monthly demos, and quarterly retreats (yes, we’ve done Normandy and Lisbon already!).
You’ll be encouraged to speak up, take ownership, and experiment. We love folks who ask “why not?” and enjoy solving problems no one’s tackled yet.

Additional Requirements
    • You must have the right to work in France – we’re unable to sponsor visas at this time.
    • This is a full-time role, based in Paris (but with flexible work-from-home options).
    • Occasional travel to other EU offices (once or twice a year) may be expected.
